A simple program for osu for creating difficulties with increased speeds stream. For example, it works great with https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/192896#osu/458582 and 130-140 bpm range.  Kind of inspired by osu trainer

TODO:
- Better look (rn it looks like shit lol)
- Some kind of smoothing to make spaced streams look more natural
